# Linting Rules

Use `./.venv/bin/pylint src` or `.\.venv\Scripts\pylint src` to address linting errors throughout this codebase. stick to these rules: line too long, trailing newlines, missing module docstring, missing class docstring, missing function or method docstring, unused imports, trailing whitespace, fstring that does not interpolate, import outside toplevel, redefining name from outer scope, lazy `%` formatting in logging functions, lambda may not be necessary, useless return at end of function or method, superfluous-parens, final newline missing. keep the docstrings concise.
